# 🇧🇪 DroneDefense Belgium – Public Overview (v1.0)

## 🕊️ Plain-Language Introduction
Welcome to **DroneDefense Belgium** — a national initiative to **protect our shared airspace** from unauthorized or dangerous drone activity.  
This project brings together **citizens, operators, government, and innovators** to build a transparent, secure, and cooperative system that keeps Belgium’s skies safe.

---

## 🌍 Why It Matters
Drones can be used for good — delivery, rescue, film, research — but also pose risks when used near airports, bases, or public events.  
Our goal is simple: **detect, respond, and learn** from every incident without fear or confusion.  
By sharing information safely, we prevent accidents, improve response, and protect everyone’s right to safe skies.

---

## 🧭 What We’re Building
DroneDefense Belgium is developing a national **Counter‑UAS Incident Log System (CILS)** — a secure platform where drone detections and incidents are recorded, verified, and analyzed.  
It ensures that every event — from a false alarm to a confirmed breach — is logged and reviewed in the same transparent way.

Key benefits:
- 📡 Real‑time awareness for police, aviation, and defense authorities.  
- 🧾 A unified, privacy‑respecting record of every incident.  
- 🧠 A feedback loop that helps Belgium learn and adapt faster.

## ⚙️ How It Works (Simple Overview)
1. **Detection:** Sensors or observers spot a drone.  
2. **Verification:** Operators confirm and log the incident.  
3. **Notification:** Alerts go automatically to police and airspace authorities.  
4. **Response:** Actions are taken to secure the area safely.  
5. **Review:** Every event is analyzed to improve future safety.  

This process ensures both **speed and accountability**, without compromising citizens’ privacy or lawful drone activity.
