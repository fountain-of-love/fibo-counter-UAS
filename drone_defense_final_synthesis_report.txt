# 🇧🇪 DroneDefense Belgium — Final Synthesis Report (v1.1)

**Prepared by:** Yves Langeraert with Enigma  
**Date:** November 2025  
**Framework:** Blueprint × FIBO × DQM × 5W2H  

---

## 🔹 Executive Summary
The **DroneDefense Belgium Documentation Suite (v1.1)** now forms a **fully coherent operational and governance framework** for national Counter-UAS implementation.  
It aligns **policy, technical, legal, and ethical layers** under a single architecture governed by the **National C-UAS Council (DGTA)**.  

All 12 files were reviewed, upgraded, and cross-linked according to:
- **5W2H** — ensuring completeness of operational logic.  
- **DQM** — ensuring data integrity, system quality, and semantic clarity.  
- **Blueprint × FIBO** — mapping systemic evolution from *Origo → Unio*.  
- **Cross-Link Coherence** — verifying interdependencies and governance traceability.
