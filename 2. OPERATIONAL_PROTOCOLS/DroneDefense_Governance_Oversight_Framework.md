# 🇧🇪 Drone Defense – Governance & Oversight Framework (v1.1)

## 🔹 Plain-Language Introduction
This framework defines **who decides what**, **how accountability is maintained**, and **how DroneDefense Belgium stays lawful, transparent, and well-coordinated**.  
It ensures that all Counter-UAS (C-UAS) activities operate within Belgium’s legal and ethical boundaries, with oversight that evolves alongside European standards.

---

## 1️⃣ Purpose & Resources
- Provide governance structure, reporting frequency, and decision-making channels.  
- Ensure coordination between civil, military, and justice sectors.  
- Maintain continuous oversight over security, privacy, and operational integrity.  

### Resource Scaling Plan
Current budget: **€350k/year**, **4 FTE** core staff.  
If DroneDefense expands to **EU-level coordination**, resource planning scales to 8–10 FTE (including one EU liaison officer and one data transparency specialist).
