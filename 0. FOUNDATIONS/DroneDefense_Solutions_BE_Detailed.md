# 🇧🇪 Drone Defense – Detailed Solution Framework (Revised v1.1)

## 🔹 Plain-Language Introduction
This document turns Belgium’s drone-defense strategy into **actionable steps** you can run now.  
It explains **who does what, when, and how** — fully within existing law — so airports, bases, ports, and public events are protected quickly and safely.

## 1️⃣ Legal & Regulatory Enablement
**Owner:** C-UAS Cell (Lead: DGTA Legal; Partners: BIPT, MoD, Federal Police)

**Goal**  
Create lawful operational space for **passive detection** and police-led interception (no jamming).

**Actions**  
1. Draft and publish **DGTA Circular: Passive C-UAS Zone** (permit template + do/don’t).  
2. File **30-day security pilot authorizations** for selected sites (airports, bases, ports, public events).  
3. Add **GDPR Annex** (purpose, minimization, retention).  
4. Prepare **Art. 42 procurement note** for urgent pilots (< €500k).

**Timeline**: **4–8 weeks** to first permits issued.  
**KPIs**: % sites permitted ≤8 weeks (target 90%), # incidents logged (100% compliant).  
**Cost Band**: €25–50k.

## 2️⃣ Institutional Integration (C-UAS Coordination Cell)
**Owner:** C-UAS Cell (MoD + FPS Interior co-chair; Members: DGTA, Police, Skeyes, BIPT)

**Goal**  
One command chain for alerts, decisions, and reporting.

**Actions**  
1. Establish **permanent C-UAS Cell** (charter, roster, weekly ops board).  
2. Publish **single alert protocol** and **contact directory**.  
3. Assign **Liaison Officers** to each major site.

**Timeline:** 3–6 months.  
**KPIs:** % incidents via single channel ≥95%, decision latency ≤3 min.

## 3️⃣ Technological Layer (Detection & Dashboard)
**Owner:** C-UAS Cell (IT + Defence C4I; Sites: Airports, Bases, Ports, Energy, Events)

**Goal**  
Rapid coverage and a shared live picture.

**Actions**  
1. Deploy **portable RF/radar kits** (Dedrone, DroneShield).  
2. Integrate feeds into a **secure national dashboard**.  
3. Standardize **alert schema** (timestamp, location, class, confidence).  
4. Enable **forensic export** (CSV/JSON).

**Timeline:** 2–6 weeks per node.  
**KPIs:** Detection accuracy ≥90%, uptime ≥95%, alert latency ≤10 s.  
**Cost Band:** €80–120k per node; dashboard €300–500k.

## 4️⃣ Procurement & Budget Path
**Owner:** C-UAS Cell + Defence Procurement + FPS Finance

**Goal**  
Buy fast, fairly, and legally.

**Actions:**  
1. Use **Art. 42 urgent security** for initial kits.  
2. **Pilot-first** mini-contracts → framework agreements.  
3. Co-fund via **cost-sharing MOUs**.

**Timeline:** 1–2 months.  
**KPIs:** PO→delivery ≤30 days.  
**Cost Band:** included in tech budget.

## 5️⃣ Strategic & Doctrinal Foundation
**Owner:** National Security Council (Secretariat) with C-UAS Cell

**Goal**  
Recognize **low-altitude security** as a national domain.

**Actions:**  
1. Draft **National Low-Altitude Security Directive (NLASD)**.  
2. Define **roles/ROE** across civil & military.  
3. Align with **NATO C-UAS** guidance.

**Timeline:** 6–9 months.  
**KPIs:** Directive adoption Q1–Q2 2026.  
**Cost Band:** Minimal (policy drafting).

---

## 6️⃣ Operational SOPs & Training
**Owner:** C-UAS Cell (Ops Branch) + Police Academy + MoD Schools

**Goal:** Consistent, fast field response.

**Actions:**  
1. Issue **SOP checklist** and **Comms Tree** (Level 0–3).  
2. Run **2–3 day training** (Level 1 Operator/Responder).  
3. Schedule **quarterly drills**; annual refresh.

**Timeline:** SOPs in 2–4 weeks; first training ≤12 weeks.  
**KPIs:** Response ≤5 min; certification ≥85%.  
**Cost Band:** €25k per course.

---

## 7️⃣ Public Communication & Deterrence
**Owner:** DGTA + Police Comms + FPS Mobility

**Goal:** Fewer illegal flights; more trust.

**Actions:**  
1. Launch **“No Drone Zone 2.0”** (signage, maps, app).  
2. Retailer pop-ups on activation.  
3. Publish **penalties & case outcomes**.

**Timeline:** 2–4 months.  
**KPIs:** Awareness ≥70%, violations ↓ year-on-year.  
**Cost Band:** ≈ €0.5M campaign.

---

## 8️⃣ Forensics & Evidence Chain
**Owner:** Federal Police Forensics + DGTA IT + C-UAS Cell

**Goal:** Turn incidents into **prosecutable cases & lessons learned**.

**Actions:**  
1. Standardize **digital evidence export**.  
2. Chain-of-custody IDs; **24-hour upload**.  
3. Monthly **analytics bulletin**.

**Timeline:** 1–2 months.

## 9️⃣ Implementation Roadmap (Condensed)
| Phase | Focus | Timeframe | Outputs |
|--------|--------|------------|----------|
| 1 | Legal permits + first nodes | 0–3 mo | DGTA circular, 3–5 nodes |
| 2 | Cell + SOP + training | 3–6 mo | Charter, Level-1 courses |
