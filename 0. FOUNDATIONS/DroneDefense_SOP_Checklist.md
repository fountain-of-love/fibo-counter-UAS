# 🇧🇪 Drone Defense – Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Checklist (Revised v1.1)

## 🔹 Plain-Language Introduction
This checklist explains what to do when an unauthorized drone appears near a protected site — such as an airport, military base, port, or large public event.  
It helps teams act **fast, legally, and safely** so people, infrastructure, and airspace stay protected.

---

## 1️⃣ Context
This SOP applies to all **authorized C-UAS sites** in Belgium operating under a valid **C-UAS Detection Permit (CDP)**.  
It aligns with national law and the **Low-Altitude Security Directive (NLASD)**.

### Alert Level Definitions

| Level | Description | Trigger Example | Response Authority |
|--------|--------------|------------------|--------------------|
| **0 – Routine** | Normal operations | System test / friendly drone | Site Operator |
| **1 – Suspicious** | Unknown drone, no clear intent | Hover near boundary | Site Security / Police |
| **2 – Threat** | Drone entering restricted zone | Near runway, base perimeter | Police + C-UAS Cell |
| **3 – Critical** | Confirmed hostile / weaponized drone | Payload / swarm | Defence + Police Command |

Target times:  
- **Detection → Confirmation:** ≤ 1 minute  
- **Confirmation → Notification:** ≤ 2 minutes  
- **Notification → Response on Site:** ≤ 5 minutes

## 2️⃣ Core Roles

| Role | Responsibility | Notes |
|------|----------------|-------|
| **Operator** | Monitor sensors, validate alerts | Must hold Level 1 certification |
| **Site Supervisor** | Coordinate local response | Liaises with Police / DGTA |
| **Police Liaison** | Take operational control at Level 2+ | Ensure evidence chain |
| **DGTA Watch Officer** | Record incident, ensure airspace closure if required | Inform Skeyes |
| **C-UAS Cell Duty Officer** | Coordinate inter-agency escalation | Maintains central log |

Minimum staffing: **2 operators + 1 supervisor per active shift**.

## 3️⃣ Step-by-Step Procedure

| Step | Action | Tool / Channel | Responsible | Target Time |
|------|---------|----------------|--------------|--------------|
| **1. Detect** | System detects signal / radar / visual cue | Sensor dashboard | Operator | — |
| **2. Confirm** | Cross-check with radar, visual camera | Dashboard + camera | Operator | ≤ 1 min |
| **3. Classify** | Determine if known (friendly) or unknown | Flight database / NOTAM | Operator | — |
| **4. Notify** | Call Police Liaison + DGTA Watch | Phone + radio + C-UAS app | Supervisor | ≤ 2 min |
| **5. Escalate** | Level 2/3 → activate C-UAS Cell | Encrypted chat / phone | Police Liaison | ≤ 3 min |
| **6. Secure Area** | Stop ground ops if near people/assets | PA / security | Site Supervisor | — |
| **7. Observe & Record** | Maintain visual / log / photo | Camera / log form | Operator | Continuous |
| **8. Intercept (if Level 3)** | Police / Defence neutralize or recover drone | Field equipment | Police / MoD | ≤ 5 min |
| **9. Restore & Report** | Resume ops; send report to C-UAS Cell | Log template | Site Supervisor | ≤ 24 h |

## 4️⃣ Communication Summary (Expressio Layer)

| From | To | Method | Message Type |
|------|----|---------|---------------|
| Operator | Site Supervisor | Voice / Dashboard Alert | Initial detection |
| Site Supervisor | Police Liaison | Phone / App | Alert escalation |
| Police Liaison | DGTA Watch | Secure call | Airspace notice |
| DGTA Watch | Skeyes + C-UAS Cell | Email / API | Incident record |
| C-UAS Cell | All | Central dashboard | Situation update |

All communications must use **approved secure lines** or the **C-UAS Dashboard Chat** (AES-256 encryption).

---

## 5️⃣ Post-Incident Actions (Resilientia + Unio)
1. Complete **Incident Log Template** (Form ID auto-generated).  
2. Submit within **24 hours** to C-UAS Cell.  
3. Include evidence files (photos, RF log, witness statement).  
4. Attend **after-action debrief** (within 7 days).  
5. Lessons learned shared monthly across sites (via C-UAS Bulletin).

---

## 6️⃣ Safety & Legal Notes
- Never use **jamming or spoofing** devices.  
- Respect GDPR – blur civilian faces in recordings.  
- Avoid engaging the drone unless cleared by Police or Defence.  
- Public messaging handled only by designated spokesperson.

---

## 7️⃣ How This Keeps People Safe
- Fast response times keep **air traffic and public spaces safe**.  
- Lawful process protects **citizens’ rights and operators’ safety**.  
- Unified reporting helps **Belgium learn and adapt quickly**.
